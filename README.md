We have some city records in a json file ( https://goo.gl/dE04nJ ). We want to find any city within 500km of Dublin (GPS coordinates 53.333, ­6.267). Write a program that will read the full list of cities and output the names of cities in a 500 km radius from Dublin, sorted by name (ascending).
You can use the first formula from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance to calculate distance, don’t forget, you’ll need to convert degrees to radians. Your program should be fully tested too.
